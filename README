This repository contains a client and a server app written in Rails to illustrate the 
ActiveResource TDD approach presented on 7/20/2010 at the East Bay Ruby Meetup.

To play with the code, run the server:

cd ebr_server
script/server -e test -p 3100

From a different shell, run the client remote specs:

cd ebr_client
spec spec/remote_models/person_remote_spec.rb 

We hope to turn this into a gem soon.
